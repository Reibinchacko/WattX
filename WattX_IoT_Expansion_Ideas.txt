[ ] Reed Switch      - Detect door/window open/close      | Topic: esp32/door/main
[ ] IR Blaster       - Control TV/AC remotely via app     | Topic: esp32/ir/command


🌬️ AC / CLIMATE CONTROL
--------------------------
[ ] Auto fan speed based on DHT22 temperature
[ ] Smart AC controller (ON if temp > 28°C, OFF < 24°C)
[ ] Humidity alert ("Living Room at 85%, turn on dehumidifier")
[ ] Comfort score card on dashboard (temp + humidity combined)


💡 SMART LIGHTING
------------------
[ ] Auto-lights via PIR motion sensor (enter room → lights ON)
[ ] Auto-off when room empty (no motion for 5 mins → lights OFF)
[ ] Day/Night auto mode via LDR (darkness detected → lights ON)
[ ] Sunrise/Sunset schedule (brightness based on time of day)


🔐 SECURITY FEATURES
---------------------
[ ] Door open alert (reed switch → notification "Main door opened!")
[ ] Motion alert at night (PIR fires 11PM–6AM → critical alert)
[ ] Security camera trigger (motion detected → start recording)
[ ] Intruder log (timeline of all motion events in Firebase)


🚿 WATER MANAGEMENT
--------------------
[ ] Tank level gauge on dashboard (ultrasonic sensor → % full)
[ ] Low water alert ("Tank below 20%, refill soon")
[ ] Auto pump control (tank < 30% → Motor 2 turns ON automatically)
[ ] Daily water usage tracker (pump runtime → litres estimate)


🔥 SAFETY & GAS
----------------
[ ] Gas leak alert (MQ2 → CRITICAL alert + auto turn off all devices)
[ ] Fire drill mode (all lights flash, alert sent to all users)
[ ] Kitchen auto ventilation (gas detected → exhaust fan ON)


📊 APP FEATURES WITH NEW DATA
-------------------------------
[ ] Live room cards  (Temp | Humidity | Light | Motion per room)
[ ] Solar panel monitoring (solar vs grid usage donut chart)
[ ] Net metering tracker (how much power exported to grid)
[ ] Floor plan view (visual house map with device status overlay)
[ ] Device health monitor (ESP32 uptime, WiFi signal, last seen)
[ ] Guest mode (limited control access for visitors)
[ ] Family sharing (multiple users control same home)


🤖 SMART AUTOMATION RULES (IF-THEN)
-------------------------------------
[ ] IF motion detected AND after 9PM → turn on bedroom light
[ ] IF temperature > 30°C → turn Fan 1 ON
[ ] IF no motion for 30 mins → turn all lights OFF
[ ] IF gas detected → turn OFF all devices + alert
[ ] IF tank < 30% → turn pump ON automatically
[ ] Smart Energy Saver Mode (one tap applies all eco rules)


🔌 NEW OUTPUT DEVICES / ACTUATORS
-----------------------------------
[ ] Servo motor     - Smart door lock / auto-close curtains
[ ] RGB LED Strip   - Mood lighting controlled from app
[ ] Buzzer/Alarm    - Sound alert when threshold exceeded
[ ] Solenoid Valve  - Auto water shutoff (gas/flood detection)
[ ] OLED/TFT Display- Wall-mounted ESP32 panel showing readings


📡 MQTT / BACKEND POWER-UPS
-----------------------------
[ ] MQTT QoS levels (guarantee delivery for critical commands)
[ ] Retained messages (ESP32 gets last state on reconnect)
[ ] Multiple ESP32 nodes (one per room, all on same HiveMQ broker)
[ ] ESP32 edge processing (on-device math before sending to cloud)
[ ] Historical data graphs (every reading stored → weekly/monthly charts)


⚡ QUICKEST WINS (Start Here!)
--------------------------------
[ ] 1. Temperature widget on dashboard from DHT22 (huge visual impact)
[ ] 2. Motion-triggered auto lights (works with existing LED control)
[ ] 3. Door open notification (reed switch = cheapest sensor possible)
[ ] 4. Water tank level gauge (ultrasonic + gauge widget in app)
[ ] 5. Room cards (visual upgrade, just add more sensors per room)
